# Hello World!

Time has come to write something here, in this forgotten site of the internet.
I started this post, like my first _C_ program many, many years ago. Do you remember your first, working soft? Was it 'Hello World'?

I name it such, becase it's my _genesis_ post. A very first one.

Probably as all other posts, I'm writing it for myself only. And the purpose of the genesis post is to make me post more often. But how?

Maybe I'll write a little bit more about blog's tech stack, but to keep it short, it's [jekyll-based blog](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Just because I love everything git(hub).

# How to create a new blog post?
It requires to create a file in the `_posts` directory, and the file should contain a date in specified format. Too much to keep in my little head. But wait, we're living in OOP-era, right?

It happens that, Tom Russell already [created python script](https://gist.github.com/tomalrussell/0828db8491b99db032fe) to make this file. Thanks Buddy!

Here how to use this thing.
`./new-post.py 'my new post title' category1 category2 ...`

If you'd ask, that's exactly how this particular post was created ;)
OK. Enought!
