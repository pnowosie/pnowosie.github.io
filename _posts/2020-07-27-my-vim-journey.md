# vim

## I saw Linux and the dream started

You might find it strange, but first time I saw Linux OS it was when I moved to Warsaw study Mathematics. Windows are very rare comparing to PLD machines in the faculty's computer lab. It was totally oposite to the Microsoft OS domination elsewhere, many of the Windowses were illegally installed as nobody really cares about licencing at the time. What about macintosh, you may ask? I hadn't heard of them as everybody I know. It was no choice than MS Windows, so discovering there is something, not that different (at least what I could see in the UI) really draw my attention.

I wanted to be recognized as an Linux expert in the eyes of my colleagues. To better pretend being one I started to spend more time in computer labs and make friends with people looks like expert in my eyes. In this community the more you could do in the terminal the more respect you had. This drives us to the bash and to the text editor. Obvoisly using vim you seemed to be like a top pro ;)

## Needless desire


## Many attempts before
