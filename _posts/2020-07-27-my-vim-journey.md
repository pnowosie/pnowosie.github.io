# vim

## I saw Linux and the dream started

You might find it strange, but first time I saw Linux OS it was when I moved to Warsaw study Mathematics. Windows are very rare comparing to PLD machines in the faculty's computer lab. It was totally oposite to the Microsoft OS domination elsewhere, many of the Windowses were illegally installed as nobody really cares about licencing at the time. What about macintosh, you may ask? I hadn't heard of them as everybody I know. It was no choice than MS Windows, so discovering there is something, not that different (at least what I could see in the UI) really draw my attention.

I wanted to be recognized as an Linux expert in the eyes of my colleagues. To better pretend being one I started to spend more time in computer labs and make friends with people looks like expert in my eyes. In this community the more you could do in the terminal the more respect you had. This drives us to the bash and to the text editor. Obviously using vim you seemed to be like a top pro ;)

## This is not gonna end well...
I've started this post more than a year ago. It started big to describe the full story, but it's not my style of writing... I'm not gonna finish it till my life :)

Let's summarize my way to vim. Everybody will have his own anyway. There are more helpful blogs already anyway.

- It was apparent there will be no deadlines near and I'm allowed to slow down a bit
- Observe what editing tricks you use most frequently during your work and prepare yourself how it can be done in git (find / replace & so on)
- No cheating allowed I moved from VS Code to Spacemacs to be forced to use vim shortcuts (However I have a coworker who could help me quickly)
- Make notes of every new shortcut - don't bet on your memory
- Whatever hard it is don't give up... things aren't fun until you're good at them
- practice, practice and more practice
